# Mern-Webpack-Template

A minimal setup for MERN stack application with custom React configurations using webpack.

## Usage

- clone the repo
- `cd` into the repo
- run `npm install` to install all required depencencies
- run `npm start` to start the application

NOTE: The configuration uses `concurrently` to run serveral commands together. In our case we serve `index.js` for frontend and `server.js` for backend

## Contributions

The process for contributions are pretty simple.
